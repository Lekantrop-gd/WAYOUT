# WAYOUT
WAYOUT is a hyper-casual game prototype based on the runner mechanic. Navigate a line through obstacles, collecting 'food' to extend its length and reach new heights.

### Key Features
- **MVP Architecture:** Implemented using the MVP pattern for flexible and independent development. Learn more on the [Unity official website](https://unity.com/how-to/build-modular-codebase-mvc-and-mvp-programming-patterns).
- **Robust Level Design Tools:** Versatile tools with two obstacle types (thanks to MVP) and gizmo visualizations for moving parts.
- **Universal Snake-like Movement:** Utilizes LineRenderer and a custom script for a realistic 'tail' movement. Feel free to use this script in your projects.

### Project Details
While still in early stages, this project shows potential for growth. Find the APK build for Android devices in the release section. Screenshots are available below.
